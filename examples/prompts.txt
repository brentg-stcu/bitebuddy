Now we need to find a recipe that matches each of the meals. The recipe's should be highly rated and only come from quality sources. Recipes need to be brief and to the point, without long descriptions. They should bullet point the ingredients and preparation instructions. The instructions should be straightforward and concise.

Lets move onto the next api request. Craft an api request that will ask for a shopping list. The shopping list will be based on the recipes generated in the last step. It should also be grouped into logical categories like meats, dairy, spices, etc. The generated shopping list should stick as closely as possible to the meal recipes. This is a shopping list so a simple cost estimate provided with each line item would be beneficial. It is ok if the estimate is only partially accurate.
